# waveletlab02
this is the second homework of wavelet transform and its applications
the main purpose is to proof that the sclar function only depends on the iterative hn and the number 
of iteratation.

lab03.m is the main script of lab03
iter_hn.m is a funcitoin of which the purpose is to get phi_{n+1} from phi_n
iter_hn_plus.m is the function to get the final results from N iteratation.
